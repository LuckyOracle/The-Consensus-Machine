# The Consensus Machine

**Mission:** To create a decentralized, open-source platform that empowers humanity to make informed, collective decisions by linking a user's right to vote on a topic to their demonstrated understanding of it.

This project aims to build a global, gamified, self-regulating "consensus engine" based on the principles of knowledge, fairness, and transparency.

### Core Principles

1.  **Knowledge Grants the Power of a Vote:** Influence over a decision is directly proportional to a user's comprehension of the subject matter.
2.  **Self-Regulation and Decentralization:** The platform's governance, from test creation to topic selection, is determined by the community, not a central authority.
3.  **Accessibility and Transparency:** All code and decision-making processes are open-source and publicly verifiable. The path to gaining a vote must be accessible to anyone with the will to learn.
4.  **Fairness and Neutrality:** All knowledge tests (quizzes) must be rigorously vetted by the community to ensure they are balanced, unbiased, and represent all sides of an argument fairly.

### How It Works: The Core Loop

1.  **Propose:** Any user can propose a topic or a specific proposal (e.g., "Adopt Policy X").
2.  **Learn & Test:** The community creates and vets multiple-choice quizzes related to that topic. To participate, a user must pass a highly-rated, unbiased quiz.
3.  **Vote:** Once a user passes the knowledge test, their right to vote on that specific topic is "unlocked."
4.  **Decide:** The collective, informed votes are tallied to form a consensus.

### Technology Stack (Proposed)

* **Backend:** Django (Python)
* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **API:** Django REST Framework

### Project Status: Phase 1 (The Blueprint)

We are currently at the very beginning of this journey. The immediate goal is to build the core "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) and attract foundational contributors.

### How to Contribute

We need developers, designers, thinkers, and moderators. Please see our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for details on how to get started, set up your environment, and make your first contribution.

**Your first task could be as simple as helping us build the basic user registration or the quiz creation form!**
